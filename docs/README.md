# CPfy
An android app I am planning to build that will notify about upcoming programming contests.

The main objective is actually to help my university juniors with something related to this.

Currently, they have to prepare and write a Facebook post about upcoming contests regularly (in our university programming group).

I want to make the process automated using this app to make the whole process easier for them, even if by a little (the app will prepare the post text and work as a reminder as well).
