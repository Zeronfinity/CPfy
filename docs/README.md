CPfy started as an effort to help my university contestants share contest information in our social media group easier and more efficiently.

It basically allows you to see a list of programming contests based on the filters you set, as well as alerts you an hour before a contest starts.

## Features
* See a list of online programming contests
* Set filters like contest start time, end time, duration, platforms to choose what list you see
* Copy the contest list you are seeing easily in a few clicks (You can also select specific contests with long press before going to clipboard)
* Get a notification alert an hour before a contest starts
* Set notification priorities based on contest platforms
